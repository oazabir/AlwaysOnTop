# AlwaysOnTop

Do you sometimes fail to notice Outlook reminder window? Do you wish a chat window would remain always on top of other windows so that you never miss a message? Here's an app for that. 

Configure which windows you want always to appear on top and you are done. 

This application runs quitely in the background, in the system tray and whenever it notices a new window has come up that you wanted it to appear alwyas on top, it will make it appear always on top.
