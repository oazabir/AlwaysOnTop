Do you sometimes fail to notice Outlook reminder window? Do you wish a chat window would remain always on top of other windows so that you never miss a message? Here's an app for that.

This application runs quitely in the background, in the system tray and whenever it notices a new window has come up that you wanted it to appear alwyas on top, it will make it appear always on top.
